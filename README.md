The HR Attrition Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of employee demographics and attrition trends. The dashboard shows that the company has a relatively diverse workforce, with the majority of employees having a background in life science. The average working years is 11.28, and the average monthly income is 6.50K.

The dashboard also shows that the Research and Development department has the highest income distribution, accounting for 63.15%. This is likely due to the fact that the Research and Development department is responsible for developing new products and technologies, which can be highly profitable.

Another key insight from the dashboard is that the majority of employees travel rarely or not at all. This suggests that the company may be able to save money on travel costs by offering more remote work opportunities.
